I'm glad that I enrolled here in X. The instructors were very detailed and meticuluous when it comes to explaining the lessons. They make sure that each student can easily grasp the information about each topic. - John Steven S. Cruz (Top 3, Chemist licensure exam 2022) -

Each session of my review journey here at X was very engaging. The instructors entertain all of the questions from the class and reinforce the discussion by giving a lot of problems/challenges regarding the topic. Personally, the tips and studying techniques that the instructors gave us, such as catchy mnemonics, helped me a whole lot in my journey as becoming a professional chemist. - Sofia C. Sy (Top 1, CHemist licensure exam 2022)

I accomplished my goal as a licensed chemist and chemical technician at the same time because of the help of X. They really prepare their students not only by teaching the topics and courses but also by giving tips and strategies on how to be ready on taking the examination. It is definitely true that choosing the right mentor makes a big difference. - Maria F. Guevarra ( )
